# 🔍 Diff-Busters  

🏆 **2nd Place - Meta RNE Hackathon** | 💰 **$60 Prize**  

## 🧐 About  
Diff-Busters is a **Python script** designed to tackle **configuration drift** in large-scale Meta data centers.  
At the hackathon, we focused on detecting and managing **config inconsistencies** across a massive number of node classes, where traditional diffing methods failed due to scale and complexity.  

🚀 **Key Features:**  
- Fast and efficient diff analysis  
- Designed for a **very specific setup** (not plug-and-play)  

## ⚙️ Running the Script  

> **Note:** This requires a very specific setup to run properly. If you're interested, tweak it to fit your environment!
